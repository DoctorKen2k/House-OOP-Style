# House-OOP-Style

This program was written in Java.

I took my main method only house calculator and wrote a object oriented version of it.

It is a calculator that gives you the option to calculate the monthly payment, commission rates, and closing cost when buying a house.

This program was written in the main method and displays if, else, loops, the use of multiple classes, and methods.

Thanks,
Ken
